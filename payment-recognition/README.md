# Payment Recognition System

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent system capable of recognizing payments through text analysis. The system leverages both custom-trained models and existing machine learning models to accurately identify payment types from extracted keywords.

## Objectives

- Utilize and enhance knowledge gained during practical assignments.
- Focus on engineering approaches for intelligent systems rather than solely on predictive model development.
- Employ existing trained predictive models (e.g., HuggingFace, OpenML, ModelZoo) and adapt them to the specific problem of payment recognition.
- Address various problems such as regression, classification, or a combination of both.

## Development Process

Before starting the project, present your idea to the assistant for validation and scope confirmation. Prepare your development environment, recommending GitHub in conjunction with DagsHub for version control. Projects should not be publicly accessible; add the assistant as a collaborating member on these platforms to monitor the project development process.

## Requirements for Positive Evaluation

- Automated data collection, versioning, and processing supported by pipelines.
- Automated validation and testing of data.
- Pipeline for training predictive models with experiment tracking and versioning of prediction models.
- Use of at least two predictive models for different tasks, including one custom-trained model and another existing trained model.
- Compression of predictive models.
- Pipeline for automated Docker image building and deployment in production.
- Monitoring of predictive models in production, including evaluation of models' performance. Access to evaluation should be available via an administrative view of your intelligent system.
- User interface focusing on intelligent interaction.
- Deployment of the solution on the web.
